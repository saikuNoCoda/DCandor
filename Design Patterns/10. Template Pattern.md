# Template Method design pattern

**Template Method** is a *behavioral* design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the `superclass` but lets `subclasses` override specifiv steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

`Note`: Template method breaks the algorithm into steps, allowing subclasses to override these steps but not the actual method.

### What
* Template Method pattern suggests that you break down an algorithm into a series of steps, turn these steps into methods and put a series of calls to these methods inside a single template method.
* These steps may either be `abstract` or have some default implementation. 
* To use the algorithm, the client is supposed to provide its own subclass, implement all abstract steps, and override some of the optional ones (called `hooks`) if needed but not the template method itself.

`HouseTemplate.java `
```java
public abstract class HouseTemplate {
    public final void buildHouse() {
        buildFoundation();
        buildPillars();
        buildWalls();
        buildWindows();
        System.out.println("House is build.");
        addSwimmingPool();
    }

    private void buildWindows() {
        System.out.println("Building Glass Windows.");
    }

    public abstract void buildWalls();
    public abstract void buildPillars();

    private void buildFoundation() {
        System.out.println("Building foundation with cement, iron rods and sand.");
    }

    public void addSwimmingPool() {}
}
```

`WoodenHouse.java`
```java
public class WoodenHouse extends HouseTemplate {
    @Override
    public void buildWalls() {
        System.out.println("Build Wooden walls.");
    }    

    @Override
    public void buildPillars() {
        System.out.println("Building Pillars with Wood coating");
    }
}
```

`GlassHouse.java`
```java
public class GlassHouse extends HouseTemplate {
    @Override
	public void buildWalls() {
		System.out.println("Building Glass Walls");
	}

	@Override
	public void buildPillars() {
		System.out.println("Building Pillars with glass coating");
	}

    @Override
    public void addSwimmingPool() {
        System.out.println("Adding swimming pool.");
    }
}
```

`ClientCode.java`
```java
HouseTemplate houseType = new WoodenHouse();
houseType.buildHouse();
System.out.println("*********");
houseType = new GlassHouse();
houseType.buildHouse();
```

`Output`
```
Building foundation with cement, iron rods and sand.
Building Pillars with Wood coating
Build Wooden walls.
Building Glass Windows.
House is build.
*********
Building foundation with cement, iron rods and sand.
Building Pillars with glass coating
Building Glass Walls
Building Glass Windows.
House is build.
Adding swimming pool.
```

# Builder design pattern

**Builder** is a *creational design* pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representation of an object using the same construction code.

`Note`- Using builder pattern make sense only when your products are quite complex and requires extensive configuration.

### Pattern 

* Why we need a builder pattern?

As we can have a constructor with a lots of parameters and most of which might remain unused making the constructur calls pretty ugly.

* What does this pattern suggests?

Builder pattern suggests that extract the object construction code out of its own class and move it to separate objects called builders. This builder lets you construct complex objects step by step and it doesn't allow other objects to access the product while being built. Important part is that you can call only those steps that are necessary for producing a particular configuration of an object.

### Director
We can further extract a series of calls to the builder steps we use to construct a product into a separate class called **director**. 
* The director class defines the order in which to execute the building steps, while the builder provides the implementation for those steps.
* The director knows which building steps to execute to get a working product.

`Phone.java`

```java
public class Phone {
    private String simType;
    private String networkConnection;
    private String country;
    private String roaming;

    public Phone(String simType, String networkConnection, String country, String roaming) {
        this.simType = simType;
        this.networkConnection = networkConnection;
        this.country = country;
        this.roaming = roaming;
    }

    public String getSimType() {
        return simType;
    }
    
    public String getNetworkConnection() {
        return networkConnection;
    }

    public String getCountry() {
        return country;
    }

    public String getRoaming() {
        return roaming;
    }
}
```

`PhoneManual.java`

```java
public class PhoneManual {
    private String simType;
    private String networkConnection;
    private String country;
    private String roaming;

    public PhoneManual(String simType, String networkConnection, String country, String roaming) {
        this.simType = simType;
        this.networkConnection = networkConnection;
        this.country = country;
        this.roaming = roaming;
    }

    public String printAboutPhone() {
        String info = "";
        info += "Mobile is " + simType + "\n";
        info += "With network connection " + networkConnection + "\n";
        info += "With roaming " + roaming + "\n";
        info += "Manufactured in " + country + "\n";

        return info;
    }
}
```

`Builder.java`

```java
/**
 * Builder interface defines all possible ways to configure a product.
 */
public interface Builder {
    void setSimType(String simType);
    void setNetworkConnection(String networkConnection);
    void setCountry(String country);
    void setRoaming(String roaming);
}
```

`PhoneBuilder.java`
```java
/**
 * Concrete builders implement steps defined in the common interface.
 */
public class PhoneBuilder implements Builder {
    private String simType;
    private String networkConnection;
    private String country;
    private String roaming;

    @Override
    public void setSimType(String simType) {

    @Override
    public void setCountry(String country) {
        this.country = country;        
    }

    @Override
    public void setRoaming(String roaming) {
        this.roaming = roaming;        
    }
    
    public Phone getResult() {
        return new Phone(simType, networkConnection, country, roaming);
    }
}
```

`PhoneManualBuilder.java`
```java

    private String country;
    private String roaming;

    @Override
    public void setSimType(String simType) {

    }

    @Override
    public void setNetworkConnection(String networkConnection) {
        this.networkConnection = networkConnection;        
    }

    @Override
    public void setCountry(String country) {
        this.country = country;        
    }

    @Override
    public void setRoaming(String roaming) {
        this.roaming = roaming;        
    }
    
    public PhoneManual getResult() {
        return new PhoneManual(simType, networkConnection, country, roaming);
    }
}
```
`Director.java`
```java
/**
 * Director defines the order of building steps. It works with a builder object
 * through common Builder interface. Therefore it may not know what product is
 * being built.
 */
public class Director {
    public void constructAndoidPhone(Builder builder) {
        builder.setSimType("Dual");
        builder.setNetworkConnection("Available");
        builder.setCountry("India");
        builder.setRoaming("Allowed");

    public void consructIPhone(Builder builder) {
        builder.setSimType("Single");
        builder.setNetworkConnection("Available");
        builder.setCountry("USA");
        builder.setRoaming("Not Allowed");    }

```

`App.java`
```java
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        Director director = new Director();

        PhoneBuilder builder = new PhoneBuilder();
        director.constructAndoidPhone(builder);

        Phone phone = builder.getResult();
        System.out.println("Sim: " + phone.getSimType());

        PhoneManualBuilder manualBuilder = new PhoneManualBuilder();

        director.consructIPhone(manualBuilder);
        PhoneManual phoneManual = manualBuilder.getResult();

        System.out.println("Phone manual: " + phoneManual.printAboutPhone());
    }
}

## Effective Java's Builder By Joshua Bloch

Bloch's Builder pattern addresses the [telescoping constructor problem](http://www.javabyexamples.com/telescoping-constructor-in-java/) by creating a static inner Builder class that can be accessed without creating an instance of the outter class (the product being build) but still has access to the outer private constructor.

* For every optional field to be set, the Builder class exposes a setter-like method, which assigns the field's value and returns the current Builder instance to build the object in a fluent way. 
* Since each method call returns the same Builder instance, method calls can be chained, which makes the client code more concise and readable.
* Bloch's Builder pattern also allows for convenient state validation during the construction preocess of the Product instance. As all fields of product needs to be final, so state validation is required only once.

    public String getIsbn() {

    public String getGenre() {

        public Builder setGenre(String genre) {

        private void validate() throws IllegalStateException {
            String infoError = "";
            if (isbn == null) {
                infoError += "ISBN cannot be null\n";
            }

            if (title == null) {
                infoError += "Title cannot be null\n";
            } else if (title.length() < 2) {
                infoError += "Title length cannot be less than two\n";
            }

            if (description != null && description.length() > 500) {
                infoError += "Description cannot have more than 500 character\n";
            }

            if (infoError.length() > 0) {
                throw new IllegalStateException(infoError);
            }
        }

        public Book build() throws IllegalStateException {
            validate();
            return new Book(this);
        }
    }
}

`Note`- In languages with named parameters, Bloch's Builder patter would be unecesary because we can provide params directly in object.

```java
public Book(String isbn = null, String title = null, String author = null) {
    this.isbn = isbn;
    this.title = title;
    this.author = author;
}

new Book(isbn = '1234", author = "notKnown");
```

# Proxy design pattern

**Proxy** is a *structural* design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. 
* Proxy controls access to original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.
* If it is performing somthing before then after finishing its processing it passes the request to service objects.
* Proxies manage the full lifecycle of their service objects.

`Note`: Proxy implements the same interface as the original class.

### Why we want to control access to an object?
The reason being we might have a massive object that consumes a vast amount of system resources and we need that object time to time, but not always.

Example: The proxy can disguise itself as a database object. It can handle lazy initialization and result caching without the client or the real database object even knowing.

In layman's term: Proxies control and manage access.

### Major type of proxies:
1. **Remote Proxy**: Controls access to a remote object.
2. **Virtual Proxy**: Controls access to a resource that is expensive to create.
3. **Protection Proxy**: Controls access to a resource based on access rights.

`User.java`
```java
public class User {
    private String name;
    private String username;
    private int role;

    public User (String name, String username, int role) {
        System.out.println("Signup and logging... user " + name + "\n");
        this.name = name;
        this.username = username;
        this.role = role;
    }

    int getRole() {
        return role;
    }

    String getUsername() {
        return username;
    }
}
```

`OfficeInternetAccess.java`
```java
public interface OfficeInternetAccess {
    public void grantInternetAccess();
}
```

`RealInternetAccess.java`
```java
public class RealInternetAccess implements OfficeInternetAccess {
    private User user;

    public RealInternetAccess(User user) {
        this.user = user;
    }

    @Override
    public void grantInternetAccess() {
        System.out.println("Internet Access granted for employee with username: " + user.getUsername());
    }
}

```

`ProxyInternetAccess.java`
```java
public class ProxyInternetAccess implements OfficeInternetAccess {
    private User user;
    private RealInternetAccess realInternetAccess;

    public ProxyInternetAccess(User user) {
        this.user = user;
    }

    @Override
    public void grantInternetAccess() {
        if (user.getRole() > 4) {
            realInternetAccess = new RealInternetAccess(user);
            realInternetAccess.grantInternetAccess();
        } else {
            System.out.println("No internet access to use under level role befow 4");
        }
    }
}
```

`ClientCode.java`
```java
        User user = new User("Ash Ketchum", "ash", 6);
        OfficeInternetAccess access = new ProxyInternetAccess(user);
        access.grantInternetAccess();

        User user2 = new User("Misty", "misty", 3);
        OfficeInternetAccess access2 = new ProxyInternetAccess(user2);
        access2.grantInternetAccess();
```

`Output`
```
Signup and logging... user Ash Ketchum
Internet Access granted for employee with username: ash

Signup and logging... user Misty
No internet access to use under level role befow 4
```

# Command design pattern

**Command** is a *behavioral* design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a request's execution, and support undoable operations.

`Note`: Good software design is often based on the principle of separation of concerns, which usually results in breaking an app into layers. And this is where Command pattern comes into picture.

Command Pattern suggests that objects shouldn't send these requests directly. Instead, we should extract all the requests details, such as object being called, the name of the method and the list of arguements into separate command class with a single method that triggers this request. 

`Note`: Access the busiess logic via a command.

### Structure
* **Sender/Invoker** class is responsible for intiating requests. This class must have fields for storing a reference to a command object. 
* Sender triggers that command instead of sending the request directly to the receiver. 
* **Command Interface** usually declares just a single method for executing the command.
* **Concrete Commands** implement various kinds of requests. A concrete command isn't supposed to perform the work on its own, but rather to pass the call to one of the business logic objects. However for the sake of simplifying the code, these classes can be merged.
* **Receiver** class contains some business logic. Almost any object may act as a receiver. Most commands only handle the details of how a request is passed to the receiver, while the recevier itself does the actual work.

### Applicability
1. When you want to parameterize objects with operations.
2. When you want to queue operations, schedule their execution, or execute them remotely.
3. When you want to implement reversible(undo/redo) operations.

`ICommand.java`
```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface ICommand {
    public void execute();
}
```

`Light.java`
```java
public class Light {
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("Light is on");
    }
    public void turnOff() {
        System.out.println("Light is off");
    }
}
```

`Fan.java`
```java
public class Fan {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Fan started...");
    }
    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Fan stopped....");
    }
}
```

`TurnOffLightCommand.java` 
```java
public class TurnOffLightCommand implements ICommand {
    Light light;
    public TurnOffLightCommand(Light light) {
        super();
        this.light = light;
    }
    public void execute() {
        System.out.println("Turning off light.");
        light.turnOff();
    }
}
```

`TurnOnLightCommand.java`
```java
public class TurnOnLightCommand implements ICommand {
    Light light;
    public TurnOnLightCommand(Light light) {
        super();
        this.light = light;
    }
    public void execute() {
        System.out.println("Turning on light.");
        light.turnOn();
    }
}
```

`StartFanCommand.java`
```java
public class StartFanCommand implements ICommand {
    Fan fan;
    public StartFanCommand(Fan fan) {
        super();
        this.fan = fan;
    }
    public void execute() {
        System.out.println("Starting fan...");
        fan.start();
    }
}
```

`StopFanCommand.java`  
```java
public class StopFanCommand implements ICommand {
    Fan fan;
    public StopFanCommand(Fan fan) {
        super();
        this.fan = fan;
    }
    public void execute() {
        System.out.println("Stopping fan...");
        fan.stop();
    }
}
```

`HomeAutomationInvoker.java`   
```java
public class HomeAutomationInvoker {
    ICommand command;
    public void setCommand(ICommand command) {
        this.command = command;
    }
    public void buttonPressed() {
        command.execute();
    }
}
```

`ClientCode.java`
```java
Light livingLight = new Light();
Fan livingFan = new Fan();
Light bedLight = new Light();

HomeAutomationInvoker remote = new HomeAutomationInvoker();
remote.setCommand(new TurnOffLightCommand(livingLight));
remote.buttonPressed();
        
remote.setCommand(new TurnOnLightCommand(bedLight));
remote.buttonPressed();

remote.setCommand(new StartFanCommand(livingFan));
remote.buttonPressed();

remote.setCommand(new StopFanCommand(livingFan));
remote.buttonPressed();
```

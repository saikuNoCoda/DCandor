# Introduction to design patterns

### OOP
**Object oriented programming** is a paradigm based on the concept of objects that contain both object and code to modify the data. 
* **Objects** are constructed from a set of *bluprints*, defined by programmers called **classes**.
* Data stored inside object's fileds is often referenced as *state*, and all the object's methods define its behaviour.
* A *parent class* is called a **superclass** and its *childern class* are called **subclasses**. Subclasses inherit state and behavior from their parent, defining only attributes/features or behaviors that differ.
* Subclasses can override the behavior of methofs that they inherit from parent classes. A subclass can completely replace the default behavior or just enhance it with some extra stuff.

### OOPS Concepts
1. **Abstraction**: Only essentials details are displayed to user i.e. hiding implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user. In other worlds, it represents all details of the relevant context with high accuracy and omits the rest.
2. **Encapsulation**: Ability of an object to hide parts of its state and behavior from other objects, exposing only a limited interface to the rest of the program. 
    * To Encapsulate something is to make it *private*.
    * Thus accessible only from within of the methods of its own class.
3. **Inheritance**: It is the ability to build new classes on top of existing ones. 
    * Major benefits of inheritance is code reuse.
4. **Polymorphism**: It is the ability of an object to pretend to be something else, usually a class it extends or an interface it implements.
    * Ability of a program to detect the real class of an object and call its implementation even when its real tyoe is unknown in the current context. 
```python
    bag = [new Cat(), new Dog()];
    foreach (Animal a : bag)
        a.makesound()
```
* **Composition**: is a *whole-part* relationship i.e. strong relationship between two objects, one of which is composed of one or more instances of other. e.g. `University *-> Department`. 
* **Aggregation**: is a less strict variant of *composition* i.e. weak relationship, where one object merely contains a reference to another. The cotainer doesn't control the life cycle of component. e.g. `Department @-> Professor`.


### Design pattern
Design pattern is a general repeatable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are pre-made blueprints i.e. description or template that can be customized to solve recurring design problem in code.

### Patterns vs algorithms
Algorithm defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level description of a solution. So same pattern can be applied to different programs in a completely different way.

`Note` - Design patterns are both smaller and more abstract than frameworks. They are really a description about how a couple of classes can relate to and interact with each other.

### Different design pattern types
Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of details and scale of applicability to the entire system being designed.

Three major groups of patterns:

1. **Creational patterns**: proivide object creation mechanims that increase flexibilty and reuse of existing code. Its all about class instantiation.
2. **Structural patterns**: explains how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient. Its all about Class and Object composition.
3. **Behavioral patterns***: take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibility between objects. Its all  Class's objects communication.

`Thought`:- If someone asks you to change something, that means someone still cares about it.


## Design Principles

### 1. Encapsulate what varies
Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

Isolate the parts of the program that vary in independent modules, protecting the rest of the code from adverse effects. As a result less time is spend on getting the program back to working shape, implementing and testing the changes. So the less time spent on making changes, the more time for implementing the features.

### 2. Program to an interface, not an implementation
Depend on abstraction, not on concrete class.

### 3. Favor composition over inheritance
Inheritance is probably the most obvious and easy way of resuing code between classes but inheritance comes with caveats which makes changing anything pretty hard.
    
* You need to implement all abstract methods of parent class even you are not using them.
* When overriding methods make sure that the new behavior is compatible with the base one so that existing code don't break.
* Inheritence breaks encapsulation of the superclass as internal details of parent class become available to the subclass.
* Subclasses are tightly coupled to superclasses.
* Parallel inheritence hierarchies.

There is an alternative to *inheritance* called `composition` where inheritance represents `is a` relationship (car is a transport) between classes where as composotion  represent `has a` relationship (car has an engine). 

`Note`: Another alternative can be aggregation, a more relaxed version (car has a driver) but driver can be driving another car not strongly linked.

**Compositon**: Objects implement a behavior on there own and they can delegate it to other objects. The added benefir is that behavior can be replaced at runtime.

### 4. SOLID Principles
* **S**ingle Responsibilty Principle: A class should have only one reason to change. Every class is responsible for a single part of the functionality provided by software. `To reduce complexity`.
* **O**pen/Closed Princible: Classes should open for extension but closed for modification. Main idea is to keep existing code from breaking when you implement new features.
* **L**iskov Substitution Principle: When extending a class, remember that you should be able to pass objects of the subclass in place of objects of the parent class without breaking the client code. `To be compatible`. 
    * Parameter types in a method of a subclass should match or be more abstract than parameters types in method of the superclass.
    * Return type in a method of a subclass should match or be a subtype of the return type in the method of the superclass.
    * Types of exceptions should match or be subtypes of the ones that the base method is already able to throw.
    * Subclass shouldn't strengthen pre-conditions.
    * Subclass shouldn't weaken post-conditions.
    * Invarients (that is true i.e. cat having 4 legs) of a subclass must be preserved.
    * Subclass should't change the values of private fields of superclass.
* **I**nterface Segregation Principle: Clients shouldn't be forced on methods that they don't use. Try to make interfaces narrow enough.
    * Class inheritance lets a class just have one superclass but it doesn't limit the number of interfaces that the class can implement at the same time.
* **D**ependency Inversion Principle: High level (contain complex business logic that directs low level classes to do something) classes shouldn't depend on low-level (implement basic operations) classes. Both should depend on abstraction.

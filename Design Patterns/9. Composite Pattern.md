# Composite design pattern

**Composite** is a *structural* design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if theuy were individual objects. It lets you run a behavior recursively over all components of an object tree.

`Note`: Using the Composite pattern makes sense only when the core model of your app can be represented as a tree. 

* Nodes and leafs of the tree have common interface so we don't need to care about the concrete classes of objects that compose the tree.
* You can treat them all the same via the common interface. 
* When you call method, the objects themselves pass the request down the tree. 
* So you don't need to know whether an object is a simple product or a sophisticated box.

### Structure
* **Component interface** describes operations that are common to both simple and complex elements of the tree.
* **Leaf** is a basic element of a tree that doesn't have sub-elements. 
* **Container/Composite** is an elements that has sub-elements i.e. leaves or other containers. 
* Upon recieving a request, a container delegates the work to its sub-elements, processes intermediate results and then returns the final results to the client.

`Shape.java`

```java
public interface Shape {
    public void draw(String fillColor);
}
```

`Triangle.java`

```java
public class Triangle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw(String fillColor) {
        System.out.println("Drawing Triangle with color: " + fillColor);
    }
}
```

`Circle.java`

```java
public class Circle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw(String fillColor) {
        System.out.println("Drawing Circle with color: " + fillColor);
    }
}
```

`Drawing.java`

```java
public class Drawing implements Shape {
    private List<Shape> shapes = new ArrayList<Shape>();

    @Override
    public void draw(String fillColor) {
        for (Shape sh: shapes) {
            sh.draw(fillColor);
        }
    }

    public void add(Shape s) {
        shapes.add(s);
    }

    public void remove(Shape s) {
        shapes.remove(s);
    }

    public void clear() {
        shapes.clear();
    }
}
```

# Observer design pattern

**Observer** or Event-Subscriber or Listener is a *behavirol* design pattern that lets us define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they're observing.

`Publishers + Subscribers = Observer Pattern`

* The object that has some interesting state is often called subject, but since it's also going to notify other objects about the changes to its state, we'll call it **publisher**.
* All other objects that want to track changes to the publisher's state are called **subscribers**.
* A subscription mechanism lets individual objects subscribe to event notification.
* Publisher notifies subscribers by calling the specific notification method on their objects.

### Structure
* The **Publisher** issues events of interest to other objects. These events occur when the publisher changes its state or executes some behaviors. Publisher contain a subscription infrastructure that lets new subscriber join and current subscribers leave the list.
* The **Subscriber** interface declares the notification interface. In most cases, it consists of single `update` method. The method may have several parameters that let the publisher pass some event details along with the update.
* When a new event happens, the publisher goes over the subscription list and calls the notification method declared in the subscriber interface on each subscriber object.
* **Concrete Subscribers** perform some actions in response to notification issued by the publisher. All of these classes must implement the same interface so the publisher isn't coupled to concrete classes.
* Usually, subscribers need some contextual information to handle the update correctly. For this reason, publishers often pass some context data as arguements of the notification method. `Note`: The publisher can pass itself as an arguement, letting subscriber fetch any required data directly.

`Note`: The list of subscribers is compiled dynamically: objects can start or stop listening to notifications at the runtime, depending on the desired behavior of your app.

### Use
* Use the Observer pattern when changes to the state of one object may require changing other objects, and the actual set of objects is unknown beforehand or changes dynamically.
* Use the pattern when some objects in your app must observe others, but only for a limited time or in a specific cases.

`EventListener.java`

```java
public interface EventListener {
    void update(String eventType, File file);
}
```

`EmailNotificationListener.java`

```java
public class EmailNotificationListener implements EventListener {
    private String email;
    public EmailNotificationListener(String email) {
        this.email = email;
    }
    @Override
    public void update(String eventType, File file) {
        System.out.println("Email to " + email + ": Someone has performed "
         + eventType + " operation with the following file: " + file.getName());
    }
}
```

`WhatsAppListener.java` 

```java
public class WhatsAppListener implements EventListener {
    private String number;
    public WhatsAppListener(String number) {
        this.number = number;
    }
    @Override
    public void update(String eventType, File file) {
        System.out.println("SMS to " + number + ": Someone has performed "
         + eventType + " operation with the following file: " + file.getName());
    }
}
```

`EventManager.java`

```java
public class EventManager {
    Map<String, List<EventListener>> listeners = new HashMap<>();

    public EventManager(String... operations) {
        for (String operation : operations) {
            this.listeners.put(operation, new ArrayList<>());
        }
    }

    public void subscribe(String eventType, EventListener listener) {
        List<EventListener> users = listeners.get(eventType);
        users.add(listener);
    }

    public void unsubscribe(String eventType, EventListener listener) {
        List<EventListener> users = listeners.get(eventType);
        users.remove(listener);
    }

    public void notify(String eventType, File file) {
        List<EventListener> users = listeners.get(eventType);
        for (EventListener listener: users) {
            listener.update(eventType, file);
        }
    }
}
```

`ClientCode.java`

```java
Editor editor = new Editor();
editor.events.subscribe("open", new WhatsAppListener("12345678"));
editor.events.subscribe("save", new EmailNotificationListener("123@gmail.com"));

try {
    editor.openFile("test.txt");
    editor.saveFile();
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

`Output`

```
SMS to 12345678: Someone has performed open operation with the following file: test.txt
Email to 123@gmail.com: Someone has performed save operation with the following file: test.txt
```
